**An AI that doesn't just talk. It acts.**

AIOPE is an Android AI assistant with 46 tools, realtime voice with full tool access, a full Linux terminal, browser automation, location awareness, live data feeds, remote server management, and the ability to build native interactive UI on the fly. It connects to any OpenAI-compatible API and runs the entire tool loop on-device.

It ships with the [AIOPE Gateway](https://github.com/XNet-NGO/aiope-gateway) -- a self-hosted inference proxy that routes to Google AI Studio, Pollinations, and other providers with a single API key. The gateway handles model routing, rate limiting, and API key management so the client stays clean.

---

## What It Does

AIOPE operates in four modes:

- **Chat** -- conversational AI with full tool access
- **Voice** -- realtime bidirectional voice with full tool access (Google Gemini Live API)
- **Plan** -- read-only analysis mode; the AI explores context and produces a structured plan without executing anything
- **Build** -- autonomous execution mode; the AI chains tools without asking for confirmation until the task is complete

The AI runs a tool loop: reason, call a tool, read the result, decide what to do next. Up to 140 rounds per turn. It handles multi-step tasks -- research a topic, write code, save it to a file, run it in the terminal, fix errors, and report back -- all in one conversation turn.

**Auto-run**: a toggle next to the send button that keeps the AI working autonomously. When enabled, after any tool use the AI automatically continues without waiting for user input. Configurable continuation prompt in Agent settings. Max 20 auto-continue rounds per chain.

### Models Per Task

Different tasks route to different models automatically:

| Task | Default Model |
|---|---|
| Chat (primary) | Gemma 4 31B IT (256K context) |
| Realtime Voice | Gemini 3.1 Flash Live Preview |
| Subagent | Gemma 4 26B A4B (MoE, 4B active) |
| Summary | Llama 4 Scout (Pollinations) |
| Title generation | Nova Fast (Pollinations) |
| Translation | Nova Fast (Pollinations) |
| Image recognition | Gemma 4 26B A4B |
| Image generation | Flux (Pollinations) |

All configurable. Any model on any provider for any task.

## Dynamic UI

The AI can render native Android UI components directly in chat. Not images. Not web views. Real Compose components.

30+ component types: text, buttons, cards, tabs, accordions, tables, forms, alerts, badges, stats, code blocks, quotes, images, icons, progress bars, countdowns, avatars, inputs, checkboxes, switches, sliders, radio groups, chip groups, select dropdowns.

Forms collect data and submit it back to the AI. Buttons trigger callbacks that continue multi-step workflows. The AI builds the UI, the user interacts with it, and the AI responds to those interactions.

Toggleable per-profile for models that don't handle structured output well.

---

## Remote Servers

Manage and connect to remote Linux servers over SSH directly from the app. Add servers in Settings with host, port, user, and an Ed25519 private key. The AI sees available servers in its system prompt and can connect, run commands, and disconnect through tool calls.

Supports Ed25519 and RSA keys via SSHJ with BouncyCastle. The companion [aiope-remote daemon](daemon/) (Go) can be deployed to servers for health monitoring and managed execution.

---

## Realtime Voice

Tap the mic button to start a live voice conversation. AIOPE connects to Google's Gemini Live API via the gateway and streams bidirectional audio in real time.

- **Full tool access** -- all 46 tools work during voice, executed natively on-device
- **Acoustic echo cancellation** -- speak while the AI is talking to interrupt
- **Live transcription** -- both user and model speech rendered in chat as it happens
- **System prompt** -- your full agent persona and instructions apply to voice sessions
- **Speakerphone mode** -- auto-enables speaker and boosts volume during voice
- **Graceful hangup** -- tap mic again to end cleanly

The AI can browse the web, run shell commands, check your calendar, send messages, and perform any action -- all by voice command.

---

## Browser

A shared WebView that both the user and AI can control simultaneously. The AI navigates pages, reads content, clicks elements, fills forms, runs JavaScript, and scrolls -- all through tool calls. Split view alongside chat or full screen.

---

## Terminal

Full terminal emulator backed by a proot Alpine Linux environment. Install packages with `apk add`, run Python scripts, compile C code, use git -- on your phone. The AI uses it through `run_proot` for anything that needs a real shell.

---

## Markdown

Powered by [UniversalMarkdown](https://github.com/XNet-NGO/UniversalMarkdown), a custom Compose renderer built on commonmark-java and Markwon:

- Syntax-highlighted code blocks with copy button
- GFM tables, task lists, strikethrough
- LaTeX math (inline and block) with PDF export
- Block quotes, headings, horizontal rules
- Native text selection across all rendered content
- Streaming animation during token-by-token display

---

## Themes

Four modes: Dark, Light, System (Material You dynamic colors from Android 12+), and Custom.

Custom mode exposes: accent color, UI surface color, primary/secondary text colors, user/AI bubble colors with opacity, background image or video with opacity. Every surface in the app respects the theme -- toolbars, pills, bubbles, tool panels, reasoning blocks.

WCAG 2.1 Level AA contrast targets in both light and dark modes.

---

## Streaming and Reasoning

Real-time SSE streaming with token-by-token display. Supports reasoning/thinking blocks from DeepSeek R1, OpenAI o-series, and any model that uses `<think>` tags. Thinking content renders in collapsible panels with shimmer animation during streaming and a fade mask for partial display.

---

## Providers

Works with any OpenAI-compatible API. Ships pre-configured for the AIOPE Gateway, which proxies to:

- Google AI Studio (Gemma 3, Gemma 4, Gemma 3n)
- Pollinations (Klein image generation, free inference)
- Any additional backend you configure

Also supports direct connections to OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, Groq, Ollama, and any custom endpoint.

MCP (Model Context Protocol) support for extending the AI with external tool servers. HTTP and SSE transports.

---

## Built By

AIOPE was built by one developer and an AI pair in under a month. No team. No funding. No office. Just a server in a house and a terminal.

~1000 commits. 46 tools. 10 languages across 26 repositories. The entire XNet software stack -- from low-level ZeroTier networking forks and TCP/IP stacks to MCP servers, a self-hosted LLM gateway, a custom markdown renderer, and the most feature-complete AI agent app on Android -- is maintained by the same person.

The developer is disabled. AI-assisted development is the accessibility tool that closed the gap between vision and execution. AIOPE exists because the same paradigm it demonstrates -- a human directing an AI to build at a pace that shouldn't be possible -- is the paradigm that built it.

No other Android app ships a Linux terminal, browser automation, SSH remote management, 46 tools with a 140-round autonomous loop, dynamic native UI generation, provider-agnostic model routing, and MCP support in a single package. The apps that come closest are backed by teams of hundreds.

This one was built by two.
